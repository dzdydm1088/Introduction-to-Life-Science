# Evolution theory

生物进化以种群为单位
population:a group of individuals of a single species that live and interbreed in a particular geographic area at the same time.

种群进化:基因频率改变

突变持续积累

遗传变化的原因:
* Random Mutation(随机突变)
* Horizontal Gene Transfer
* Recombination
* Genetic Drift 偶然事件>真实优劣

### Natural Selection
1. There is variation existing in the population.
2. There is variation existing in the population.
3. There is heredity.
4. End Result.

Mechanisms of Evolutionary Change:
* Mutation
* Migration
* genetic drift
* natural selection

Gene pool:
sum of all copies of all alleles at all loci in a population

Allele frequency:
proportion of each allele in the gene pool

Genotype frequency(基因型频率):
proportion of each genotype among individuals in the population

species:
a group of individuals that actually or potentially interbreed in nature

Causes of Speciation:
* Geographic isolation
* Reduction of gene flow
